An Interactive Visualization of how a Neural Network Operates

The goal of this project is to provide a simple and intuitive interface to visualize how nodes operate within a neural network. 

## Usage
Use your mouse or touch input to draw digits (0-9) on the canvas. You can switch between the eraser and pencil tools to edit the drawing.

The neural network will analyze the drawn image and display the predicted number on the screen as you draw, providing real-time updates. 

To clear the canvas and start fresh, press the Clear button. This allows you to draw a new number without interference from the previous drawing.
